# BMI Calculator
This is a responsive BMI Calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index by entering age, gender, height, and weight.

3) **Calculation Stage**
   - Height is converted into meters :
     - Height¬†(m) = (Feet √ó 12 + Inches) √ó 0.0254
   - BMI is calculated using :
     - BMI = Weight¬†(kg) / (Height¬†(m) ^ 2)
4) **Result Display Stage**
   - The calculated BMI value appears at the bottom of the form.
   - The BMI Category (Normal, Underweight, Overweight, Obese) is displayed alongside the numeric value.
